# attendance-app
Workshop attendance app for back2bikes volunteers.

This app's intention is to address this [Problem Statement](http://devblog.back2bikes.com.au:8080/blog/attendance/)

# User Interface
The UI has been roughed out and the pics below are intended as a guide only.

*Good work Joe!*

*I'm not sure if we have any fat cat volunteers*

## Check-in Confirmation assumptions
- Attendance is based on an honour system. No one really needs to sign in or out so ...
- Attendance is more of a check in process
- Attendees usually have a rough idea how long they're going to be in the work shop for, so when they check in they just need to indicate that up front - which obviates the need to "sign out". If they skip off home after half an hour, no biggie.

#### For some reason github displays this horizontally not vertically ...

It's because the orientation of the image is stored in the meta data, and github is respecting that :)

## React Epiphany
Plan to re-implement initial start using this overlay as the basis for react componentry:
