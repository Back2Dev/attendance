# Attendance App

### Mission Statement

As we have grown, we have realised the need to keep records, especially for insurance reasons.

We want to _Log attendance_

This app provides a really easy way for volunteers to sign in, and this helps us to track who has come, recognise our regulars, and reach out to people who stop coming.

---

### Getting Started

1. Install Meteor here: [https://www.meteor.com/install](https://www.meteor.com/install)

2. Run the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/Back2bikes/attendance.git`

`cd attendance/meteor-app`
`meteor npm install`

_*This next command can take a while the first time*_
`meteor run`

**What is Meteor?**
Meteor is a JS based framework similar to the _*[MERN](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-mern-stack-tutorial/) / [MEAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhRdqbEXp9Y)*_ stacks.

Meteor uses Javascript for coding the front, back and server.

What seperates it from these stacks is that Meteor is run as a single product designed to ensure all parts work together.

_*It takes functionality that you would ordinarily need to code and 'Magics ' it into the App from the start.*_

### App Design

Meteor Apps are run off the [MVC design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and seperate where data can flow.

**Components**

Re-usable Components are found within `/meteor-app/imports/ui/components`

All other pages/ components are page specific within their own folder in: `/meteor-app/imports/ui/`.

The app consists of 8 high-level components. They are:

1 . Display-user component

2 . Admin Panel component

3 . Service Selector Component

4 . Bike assessment component

5 . Bike assessment review component

6 . Customer details component

7 . Confirmation component

8 . Current bike jobs component

### Styling

The Attendance App is using [Semantic UI](https://atmospherejs.com/semantic) for styling.

This package is automatically synced with the Semantic UI repo.

[Learn Sematic](http://learnsemantic.com/) | [Official Repository](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) | [Semantic-UI Homepage](https://semantic-ui.com/)

Each folder possesses it's own semantic.min.css file

---

### Database

Meteor integrates with MongoDB and creates a mini MongoDB that lives on the client side within their session.

Any requests/ updates from them will impact on their session database only.

By providing a seperate DB to the user we limit any pull/push requests and ensure a seamless use of the website.

Updates to the actual database will performed without impacting on website load times/ UX.

[MongoDB Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/) | [Tutorials](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/)

**Dummy data** _*for development only*_
The script to populate the app with dummy data is in `meteor-app/imports/startup/server/members-data.js`

To reset the data to the initial state run: `meteor reset`

When you next run `meteor run` the startup script will repopulate the DB.

> Remember to update this file when you update/ change data fields that a user will need.

---

### Schemas

Some shared controller/methods for schema calls can be found here: `/imports/api/schema.js`

**Member records** :`/imports/api/members/`

**Session records** : `/imports/api/sessions/`
An individual session record will be created for user interactions.

**Bike assessments/ Jobs** : `/imports/api/assessments/`

---

### Story Book

Each Component within the App should be built Dumb/ Pure. It should render independant of any imports.

Any logic should be created within a backend controller and passed to it as props.

Story Book will need to be installed on your machine by running: `npx -p @storybook/cli sb init`

| Component name  |     StoryBook name      |
| :-------------: | :---------------------: |
| `PascalCase.js` | `PascalCase.stories.js` |

---

### Testing

Tests are performed through a combination of JEST and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

begin tests by cd'ing into the `attendance/meteor-app` folder and running:

`meteor npm run debug.b2b`
Also run:
`npm run cypress:open`

`npm run cypress:open`

> Ensure that all Node Packages are up to date before running tests

## << Check on this part re: tests to run. There are too many scripts and many seem broken >>

### how the App uses Meteor

Meteor controls how data is accessed 'under the hood' through it's functions:

- `Meteor.publish`

and

- `Meteor.subscribe`

By default, everything that has been '_*published*_' is available to the entire project by using the '_*subscribe*_'.

If you publish data, you can _*subscribe*_ to that data in any file.
_*This is similar to a Redux Store.*_

> This is convenient during development, but itâ€™s a security issue that must be addressed in the code before launching the application.

> More information on this can be found under [autopublish](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/publish-and-subscribe)

To share a Mongo Collection through-out the App
i.e. `const Members = new Mongo.Collection('members')`

_Publishing_
you can do the below to share the newly created collection across the App.
in the below example, all.members could be changed to anything as you are assigning a name to the data.

```
const members = Meteor.publish('all.members', () => {
  return Members.find({})
})
```

_Subscribing_
To access the information inside a file, you can subscribe as below:

```
Meteor.subscribe(members')
```

_It is recommended to read through the [tutorial](http://www.discovermeteor.com/blog/understanding-meteor-publications-and-subscriptions/) as you want to only subscribe to specific information to limit memory allocation_
