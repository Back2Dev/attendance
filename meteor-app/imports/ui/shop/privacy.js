          This Privacy Policy is the official privacy policy of Back2bikes Ltd and its subsidiaries and other related
          bodies corporate (“Back2bikes”). It applies to all personal information collected by Back2bikes, including via
          www.back2bikes.com.au and any related Back2bikes website, social media page, internal website or intranet
          (each a Website); any Back2bikes mobile or tablet application (each an Application); and from an individual
          via any other means, including physically or electronically (together, the Collection Channels).

      <li>
        <p>
          In this policy we explain how and why we collect your personal information, how we use it and disclose it, and
          what controls you have over our use of it. We appreciate that you may have certain concerns about how your
          personal information is collected, used and shared. We can assure you that we will always handle your personal
          information securely and carefully. Among other things, we comply with all applicable Australian privacy laws
          including the Australian Privacy Principles.

        <p>
          In addition to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, there may also be specific and additional privacy and
          consent provisions that apply to certain Collection Channels. Because those specific and additional provisions
          also relate to your privacy protection, we recommend that you review them wherever they appear. In the event
          of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and those other specific and additional
          provisions, the specific and additional provisions will prevail.

      How Back2bikes collects, uses and discloses personal information

      provided in this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h3 id="activeinformationcollection">Active information collection</h3>

    <p>In particular, Back2bikes will collect your personal information from you in the following situations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you contact Back2bikes, we may keep a record of that correspondence;</li>

      <li>When you participate in any offers, promotions or marketing activities.</li>

      <li>When you apply for and/or establish and/or access an account or order a product;</li>

      <li>When you conduct certain types of transactions such as cheque purchases or refunds;</li>

      <li>
        When you submit your e-mail address via a Website or Application or provide us with personal information via any
        medium, including a Website or Application;
      </li>

      <li>
        When you place an order via a Website or Application to purchase goods, in which case we may require you to

        financial information (such as credit card details);
      </li>

      <li>When you interact with a Website or Application for a specific purpose; and</li>

      <li>When you use or browse a Website or Application generally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="cookiesandpassiveinformationcollection">Cookies and Passive Information Collection</h3>

    <p>
      As you navigate through our Websites and access our Applications, certain information can be passively collected
      (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies,
      Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, and clickstream data). For
      example, we may collect information about matters including but not limited to the date, time and duration of
      visits and which pages of a Website or Application are most commonly accessed. This information is generally not
      linked to the identity of visitors, except where a Website or Application is accessed via links in an email or
      another electronic message we have sent or where we are able to uniquely identify the device or user accessing a
      Website or Application, such as when you are logged into an account.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may combine your anonymous or personal visitor session information or other information collected through
      tracking technologies with other personal information collected from you from time to time via our Collection
      Channels, in order to understand and measure your online experiences and to determine what products, promotions
      and services are likely to be of interest to you. By accessing a Website or Application via links in an email we
      have sent and/or by accessing a Website or Application where you have identified yourself, you consent to the
      collection of such information where it is personal information.
    </p>

    <h3 id="platformandbrowserpermissions">Platform and Browser Permissions</h3>

    <p>
      You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is
      offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your
      preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mobile platforms such as iOS and Android generally define certain types of information or data that applications
      cannot access without your consent. Each platform has its own permissions system for obtaining your consent. For
      example, the iOS platform generally alerts you the first time an Back2bikes Application wants permission to access
      certain types of data, such as location services, and will let you choose whether or not to consent to that
      request. Android devices will generally notify you of the permissions that an Back2bikes Application seeks before
      you first use the Application, and your use of the Application constitutes your consent. For iOS devices, you can
      generally manage your platform level permissions via the Settings section on your device. For Android devices, you
      can generally manage your platform level permissions.

    <p>
      We may use or disclose personal information held about an individual for the primary purpose for which it is
      collected - that is, to carry on our business and provide services to our customers. We may also use such
      information for a purpose related to the primary purpose of collection and where you would reasonably expect that
      we would use the information in such a way (e.g. major delivery companies, mail houses and third-party fulfilment
      contractors). This information is only disclosed to persons outside our business in the circumstances set out in
      this policy or as otherwise notified to you at the time of collection of the information, or with your permission.

      </li>

      <li>
        Where we reasonably suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in and the use or

      </li>

      <li>
        Where such use or disclosure is required under or authorised by law (for example, to comply with a subpoena, a

      Despite removing your name from the database from receiving future advertising and marketing information, we may
      send you non-commercial “Administrative Emails”. Administrative Emails relate to your user account and may include
      administrative and transaction confirmations, requests and inquiries or information about a particular user

      Our Websites may, from time to time, contain links to the websites of other organisations which may be of interest
      to you. Their inclusion cannot be taken to imply any endorsement or validation by us of the content of the third
      party website. Linked websites are responsible for their own privacy practices and you should check those websites

      in Marketing, Stores, Finance and IT have access to our customers' personal information. Their access is subject
      to strict controls and procedures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our e-commerce sites use a security measure called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL locks all your

      protect users' personal information, Back2bikes cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
      transmitted to it or from its online products or services, and users do so at their own risk. Once Back2bikes
      receives your transmission, it makes every reasonable effort to ensure its security on our systems. Personal
      information is de-identified or destroyed securely when no longer required by us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back2bikes retains the information you provide to us including your contact and credit card details to enable us
      to verify transactions and customer details and to retain adequate records for legal and accounting purposes. This
      information is held on secure servers in controlled facilities.

      Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) which is a global information security standard applying to all
      organisations that store, transmit or process credit card information - including Back2bikes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The new standards have been developed to help protect our customers, team members, and suppliers from fraud and
      identity theft by ensuring that credit card data is handled securely throughout all transactions and interactions
      including Point of Sale (POS), fax, phone, online orders and email communication
