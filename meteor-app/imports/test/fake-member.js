  reasons: `My love of bikes started as a child. It was my transport growing up, 
  	I had no money to pay for repairs, so I had to fix it myself. My best bike 
  	was a white Sun 10 speed racer. I saved up for months to buy it. I saved
  	money from my paper round, and my dad threw some money in too.
