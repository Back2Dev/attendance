Since then I ride 5-6 days a week and have retired my car in favour of 2 wheels. In the last 4 months I have spent at least 100 hours at The Bikery (a non-profit bike shop based at Monash University) building up bikes, helping people fix their bikes and learning as much as I possibly can. To say I'm obsessed would probably be an understatement. I love riding, building and helping others both find the sport and to get back on the road - Volunteering scratches all of those itches. One day I hope to become a paid mechanic, but for now I'm just happy being up to my elbows in bike parts and grease while hopefully passing on my love for hitting the road. I have a lot of time to spare during the week so I'm hoping to use this time to learn as much as possible."

I have never had a drivers license because I have never needed one - I have my bike and that is how I like to travel. I have always had a hands on DIY attitude whether it be building and fixing my bikes to building and fixing computers - for myself and friends. I had been looking at the Bike Maintenance course that used to be around but I think has since been shut down for a few years. As I am   unemployed at the moment I came across your site and thought it would be a great opportunity to fill in the gaps in my experience and to have achieved something for the day that I can see and touch and will potentially make someone very happy. I am also extremely interested in the Advanced Maintenance course you mention on your site and am going to apply for it. I see alot of perfectly rideable bikes being thrown away around South and Port Melbourne and I strongly believe in recycling (no pun intended) and using what you have to work with. I am good with my hands, learn fast have a genuine love for bikes and riding and would love to learn some new skills while putting what I already know to good use."

Back 2 Bikes is one way that I'd like to do this. I don't have much in the way of existing skills but I'm keen to learn and have plenty of free time at the moment to lend a hand.\n\nI have a working with Children's Check (if that's required) and I'm available most weekdays.\n\nHope to hear back!\n\nPat"
