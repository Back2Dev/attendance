## Our challenge

Back2bikes is a place where we fix bikes. Our volunteers love doing that, and they are not really interested in paper work or administration.

## Logging attendance

As we have grown, we have realised the need to keep records, especially for insurance reasons.

This app provides a really easy way for volunteers to sign in, and this helps us to track who has come, recognise our regulars, and reach out to people who stop coming.

## Parts ordering


## Service booking


## Thanks to our friends and sponsors

Thanks to [Browser Stack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for free access to their tools. Without it we would have to beg, borrow or steal a bunch of computers and setups that we can bring up at will from a browser. Magic!
