Workshop attendance app

## The business problem

Volunteers sign up, and come along to fix bikes in the workshop. While we make our best efforts to welcome them, tell the story about us, and give them a bike to work on, sometimes they either never come or don't stay.

An attendance system can record who is doing sessions at back2bikes. and more importantly we can tell when they stop coming. This will give us the chance to send them an email and ask the reason, and if it was due to a perception oe an incident, we'll have a chance to address it.

We prefer that volunteers work not on their own bike, but on one of our projects. We do want to allow them to work on their own bikes, but only after they have done a number of sessions with us, and at designated times.

## Update

2 teams from Coder Academy are working on adding features to the app
