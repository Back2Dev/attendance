# Casual attendance

Your name is in the Peak Adventure database as a casual. We have introduced a sign-in system, and we'd like you to register your card details for automatic payment. So when you do a training session, you won't need to bring cash. The system will charge your card automatically.

Please follow this link CARD-LINK to update your personal details, and record your card for future use.

## The same personal service

Peak Adventure aren't about to become all corporate and impersonal. The new system will just make it easier for everyone, and we hope it doesn't get in the way of enjoying our training sessions.

## Where are my card details stored?

We use an Australian payments provider called Pin Payments, who are fully PCI/DSS compliant. Their system stores your card securely, and the PA membership system stores a reference id for the card. When it comes to payment time, we send that reference id to Pin Payments, and they will charge your card.

## Can I cancel?

There is no need to cancel, but you can ask for your card details to be deleted from the system.

### Privacy policy

You can read about our privacy policy here: PRIVACY-LINK. The short version is that we value your privacy, and won't be spamming you or selling your details to third parties to spam you.
