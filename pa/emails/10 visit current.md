# Your 10 visit pass is running down
Your 10 visit pass has been partially used, or expires on EXPIRY-DATE. You can go to  CARD-LINK to pre-reserve a new 10 visit pass. This will automatically renew after the last session of your current pass.

## New Peak Adventure sign-in system
If you have been to Sandridge recently, you've probably seen and used the new sign in system, which is replacing the old sign in sheets and cards. Please make sure that your details are up to date on the system. 

## The same personal service
Peak Adventure aren't about to become all corporate and impersonal. The new system will just make it easier for everyone, and we hope it doesn't get in the way of enjoying  our training sessions.

## Where are my card details stored?
We use an Australian payments provider called Pin Payments, who are fully PCI/DSS compliant. Their system stores your card securely, and the PA membership system stores a reference id for the card. When it comes to payment time, we send that reference id to Pin Payments, and they will charge your card.

## Can I cancel?
You can cancel your 10 visit pass any time up to 1 week before it expires. We can refund you any unused portion of the membership, less a $10 administration fee.

### Privacy policy
You can read about our privacy policy here: PRIVACY-LINK. The short version is that we value your privacy, and won't be spamming you or selling your details to third parties to spam you.
