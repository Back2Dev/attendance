# Back2bikes - Bike Assessment app

## Problem statement

We fix bikes, either for sale, or customer bikes. At present we have a paper form which doesn't work very well.

We need to do a thorough assessment of the bike when the customer brings it in.

By doing this, we can accurately determine what needs to be done, and how much it will cost.

Often the cost of repairs is more than the bike is worth. Knowing the cost ahead of time allows us to have a conversation with the customer about a go/no-go decision while they are still there.

## Desired outcome

A wizard which leads you through recording what needs to be done on the bike. 

A simple checklist guides you to check each part of the bike, and you tick a box to say what needs to be fixed (eg replace/service/nothing)

It keeps track of the cost as you go, and once it gets to a certain price it may warn that the cost is getting high (might be useful to nter the value of the bike up front)

At the end it provides a review of the items to be fixed, and allows the list to be edited (if some items are not to be fixed).

## Potential extension

* Print out a job card
* Provide a list of current jobs
* Search by bike/customer/status etc. 
* Mark job as completed
* Send invoice to customer etc.
