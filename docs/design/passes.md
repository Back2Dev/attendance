# Passes

This document provides details of how passes work.

A member buys a product which is one of

- A 10 visit pass
- A pay as you go (casual) pass

These products will be set up to be self contained. Eg each one has a start date, end date, and an expiry date, as well as a status value.

Valid status values are

- Active (still has remaining credit)
- Expired (end date has passed)
- Finished (all visits have been used)
