## Why do we need a component for conditional rendering?

Suppose we have `Card` component that has a `title`, `summary` and optionally a `desc` prop.
And if `desc` exists, then the `Card` should be clickable to show additional information.
Otherwise, just show the card. We could write something like:

```jsx
  const Card = ({ title, summary, desc }) => (
  <div>
    {desc ? (
      <a href="#more-info">
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <p>{summary}</p>
      </a>
    ) : (
      <div>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <p>{summary}</p>
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
```

but the content in the `Card` has been repeated. ie. the code isn't DRY. In `ConditionalWrap`, the
content is the children (no duplication here) and the wrapping elements are supplied by two render props
`wrapTrue` and `wrapFalse`.

Another use case for `ConditionalWrap` is for rendering different wrappers depending on the screen
width. In desktop widths, there is normally more padding around the content than in mobile.

## Default usage

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story story={stories.Default} name="Default" />
</Canvas>

Click `show code` above and you will see that if `condition` prop is `true`, then the `wrapTrue`
wrapper element is rendered. Otherwise, `wrapFalse` will be rendered. By default, it renders the
`wrapFalse` element

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

## Stories

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.TrueCondition} name="TrueCondition" />
</Canvas>

In this story, `condition` prop is `true` so we render `wrapTrue`. Note that it is not neccessary to
provide both render props because the unspecified prop will render the children in a div by default.
You must, however provide one or the other.
